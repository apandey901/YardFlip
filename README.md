## Introduction

**YardFlip** aims to create a user-friendly and robust mobile environment using React Native. The app is designed with scalability and ease of development in mind, using best practices for mobile app development, type-safe coding with **TypeScript**, and **Expo** for quick deployment. Developers can easily extend functionality and maintain the app thanks to its modular architecture.

## Features

- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web).
- Modular and scalable codebase.
- TypeScript-based for improved developer experience.
- Integration with external services via APIs.
- Hot-reloading for faster development using Expo.
- Support for automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Core framework for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Expo**: Simplifies the development process, providing tools for building and running the app.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability.
- **JavaScript**: Used for certain dynamic functionality.
- **Python**: Occasionally used for automation and back-end processing.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Expo Go**: Download the Expo Go app from [expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go) for testing on your mobile device.
- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm are installed.

Check versions with:
```bash
npm --version
node --version
```

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apandey901/YardFlip.git
cd YardFlip
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the App

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
expo start
```

Scan the QR code in the Expo Go app to view the app on your mobile device. Alternatively, run on a simulator:

```bash
expo run:android  # for Android
expo run:ios      # for iOS (Mac only)
```

To run the app in a web browser:

```bash
expo start --web
```

## API Documentation

YardFlip integrates with several APIs to handle authentication, data management, and third-party service interactions. The API services are encapsulated in the `src/services/` directory, ensuring clean, modular code.

### 1. **Authentication API**

The Authentication API supports user login, registration, and session management. It integrates with OAuth providers (e.g., Google) as well as custom email/password authentication.

- **Login**: Authenticate users.
- **Register**: Create new user accounts.
- **Session Management**: Manage user sessions and handle login states.

### 2. **Data API**

The Data API is responsible for retrieving and managing application data. This could be data from a remote database or other external services.

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch items or lists from the backend.
- **Data Submission**: Submit new items or data to the server.

### 3. **Third-Party API Integrations**

YardFlip also interacts with external APIs, such as weather services or geolocation. These integrations follow the same modular design, allowing easy replacement or updates in the future. API keys and sensitive data are securely stored using environment variables in the `.env` file.

### Error Handling

Each API service includes built-in error handling to manage failed requests or connection issues. The app will notify the user of errors and provide fallbacks where necessary.

## Testing

YardFlip includes unit tests using **Jest** to ensure code quality. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and include unit tests for core services and components. Code coverage is generated automatically to help track the robustness of the test suite.
